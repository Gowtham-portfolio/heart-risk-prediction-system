# ❤️ Heart Risk Prediction System

A machine learning–based system designed to analyze patient health data and predict the risk of heart disease with high accuracy and clear visual insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in prevention and treatment.  
This project focuses on building a **data-driven heart risk prediction system** that learns patterns from medical data and helps identify patients who may be at risk.

The system processes health attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and lifestyle indicators to generate meaningful predictions.
